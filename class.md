Talking about problem solving

How have people solved problems?


Congressional App challenge


1. Define the problem, what are you trying to solve? What would it look like if the problem were solved?
2. Decompose the problem into several small problems
3. Figure out how to tackle each sub problem
 


I'd add something like: Break the problem down into 3-5 smaller parts. If you have trouble describing in detail how to solve those parts in a few sentences, break those parts down into 3-5 parts. If you have trouble breaking a problem down into 3-5 smaller parts, you can probably describe in detail how to solve it.


It's a recursive process - for each problem-chunk, you should either describe how to solve it in a small number of sentences OR break it into a small number of smaller parts

 
It's much easier to have paper models first before going to higher fidelity
In my design class we drew stuff out on paper and then created various paper buttons and things that we would stick together to create the mock up

We would then do the human computer exercise with a user and just move the paper around
It was way easier than trying to program anything
Plus it gives you an appreciation for how hard it is to really define a problem
WAY more difficult than writing code


I brought this up in lecture in the Technology Project Post Computer AP Management class - with the tools we have available it's super easy to make a mostly functional mockup that looks a lot like the finished product, but doing so is actually counter productive for two reasons

The first is that a more polished design often looks like it's too far along to make major changes, even though the mockup is very flexible and took low effort

The second is that it makes less technical reviewers believe that the product itself will take far less time because the exterior visible portion is already "mostly complete"
The root cause in both cases being that a high fidelity mockup gives the impression of significant effort and functionality

It looks like it's already done so everyone behaves incorrectly believing (even subconsciously!) that the project is mostly already complete

To the point that there's UI mockup tools out there that deliberately look like you're sketching something out on a napkin

We also talked about that in the Project Post-AP Management CS class, that sometimes you start a project and realize in the initiating phase that the proper solution isn't to build something but to just use some existing thing instead

The class should be about what the student wants to create and the teachers role should be that of a mentor helping them achieve that creation, learning the various skills they need along the way.

A sense of ownership and control over their project should motivate students more intrinsically than following rote problems.

The student should be in control of their own learning and should feel in control, the role of teh teacher is to create an environment where students are directed in a certain direction and presented with problems that help grow their skills.
