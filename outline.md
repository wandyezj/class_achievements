# Class Achievements Outline

# Summary

The idea behind class achievements is to provide support for a Standards Based Grading approach for a TEALS introductory to Computer Science class.

The ideas and research behind Standard Based Grading come from:

* *The Leader's Guide to Standards: A Blueprint for Educational Equity and Excellence* by Douglas B. Reeves 
* *McKeachie's Teaching Tips*

Standards Based Grading focuses less on assignments and more on achieving student learning objectives.

For Example: A student who struggles initially with a subject but who then meets all objectives on the last day of a course should do just as well in a course as a student who has mastered all objectives at the begining of the course.

Learning objectives are be defined at a high level along with specific ways that students can demonstrate they have achieved those objectives. This makes it clear to students and teachers exactly what is required to achieve all course objectives up front.


Meaning that for any class objective students have many options available for them to demonstrate that they have met the classroom objective.
