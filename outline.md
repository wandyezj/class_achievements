# Class Achievements Outline

# Summary

The idea behind class achievements is to provide support for a Standards Based Assessment approach for a TEALS Introduction to Computer Science class.

The ideas and research behind Standard Based Assessment come from:

* *The Leader's Guide to Standards: A Blueprint for Educational Equity and Excellence* by Douglas B. Reeves 
* *McKeachie's Teaching Tips*

Standards Based Assessment focuses less on assignments and more on achieving student learning objectives.

For Example: A student who struggles initially with a subject but who then meets all objectives on the last day of a course should do just as well in a course as a student who has mastered all objectives at the begining of the course.

The class expectation is that **all** students will meet **all** class objectives.

Learning objectives are defined at a high level along with the specific ways that students can demonstrate they have achieved those objectives. This makes it clear to students and teachers exactly what is required to achieve all course objectives up front.

> Research has shown that students do better in classes that state clear learning objectives up front.

Learning objectives should be assessed across all stages of Blooms Taxonomy. {Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create}

> It's critical that students are able to master all levels of Blooms Taxonomy for each learning objective. Developing each students higher level thinking skills is especially critical as these skills are widely applicable.

Students should have many options available for them to demonstrate that they have met a class objective.

# The purpose of assessment is to improve performance.

> The highest level of personal satisfaction and self esteem comes not from false affirmation and avoidance of challenges but from success after a series of trials and errors.

The purpose of the site is to make the class objectives clear and provide clear consistent feedback about what needs to be done to improve class and individual student performance.


# Specific Site Support Goals

The following are the specific high level scenarios the site should achieve.

* Allow the creation of standard objectives and how their achievement can be assessed for a class.
* Keep track of each students progress towards the classes learning objectives.
    * The teacher should be able to see each students progress toward achieving each objective.
    * The teacher should be able to modify each students progress toward each objective.
    * Each student should be able to see each class objective and what they need to do achieve it.
    * Each student should be able to see their current progress towards and achievement of each class objective.
    * Each student should be able to note their own progress towards each objective.
        * Each student should be able to indicate areas they think they have achieved and areas they are struggling with.


# Site Interactive Scenarios

The site will make it readily apparent to teachers how their class is doing, what areas they need to focus on with what groups of students.

The site will be a good tool for teachers to communicate with parents early and often exactly how well their student is doing in class.

The site will make it easy for teachers to report to administrators their classes progress.





# Suggested High Level Objectives for Introduction to Computer Science

High level objectives should not be tied to any specific programming language or environment. The high level ideas and concepts should be applicable to any system that students are attempting to describe.

For example: Factories, Restaurants, Traffic, etc...

High level objectives in turn can be broken down into more specific objectives and specific ways they can be demonstrated.

## High Level Objectives Sample

* Problem Solving Techniques
    * Problem Definition
        * Inquery, research, elicitation
    * Divide and Conquer
    * Isolation
* Data
    * Input
    * Output
    * Types
* Flow
    * Sequential
    * Conditional
        * Boolean Logic
    * Repetative

There are potentially additional objectives around communication and teamwork as these are essential for problem solving. Strong teams are made of strong individuals who work together well.
