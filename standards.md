# Standards

Specific standards for a TEALS Introductory Computer Science Curriculum.


# Objective Format

Objectives shoudl be specific enough that they can be assessed with a small set of specific questions.

Objectives will be presented in the following format:

## Objective Name

### Objective

Description of what the student is expected to achieve.

### Justification

Description of why the student is expected to achieve this ojective.

### Assessment

Description of how the student can know they have achieved the objective.

# Objectives

## programming.control.loops.infinite
Identify Infinite Loops

### Objective

Student can identify identify loops and correct them when needed.

### Justification

Infinite loops are a common problem when learning loops and students need to know how to avoid them and deal with them.

### Assessment

Student can write an infinite loop.
Student can identify an infinte loop in a program.
Student can halt a program with an infinite loop.


## programming.control.flow.concepts
Flow Concepts

### Objective

Students can explain the three types of flow {Sequential, Conditional, Repetative}

### Justification

Understanding the three types of flow is essential for describing most computational tasks.

### Assessment

Students can 




## programming.data.lists.concepts
List Concepts

### Objective

Students understands basic list properties:
* Ordered (elements have an order)
* Indexable (each element has an index starting from 0)
* Mutable (append, insert, delete)

### Justification

Lists are an essential data structure for most non-trivial programs.

### Assessment

Students can describe list properties to the instructor and fellow students.
