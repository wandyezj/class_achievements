# Standards

Specific standards for a TEALS Introductory Computer Science Curriculum.


# Objective Format

Objectives shoudl be specific enough that they can be assessed with a small set of specific questions.

Objectives will be presented in the following format:

## Objective Name

### Objective

Description of what the student is expected to achieve.

### Justification

Description of why the student is expected to achieve this ojective.

### Assessment

Description of how the student can know they have achieved the objective.

There are potentially additional objectives around communication and teamwork as these are essential for problem solving. Strong teams are made of strong individuals who work together well.




# Objectives

## programming.control.loops.infinite
Identify Infinite Loops

### Objective

Student can identify identify loops and correct them when needed.

### Justification

Infinite loops are a common problem when learning loops and students need to know how to avoid them and deal with them.

### Assessment

Student can write an infinite loop.
Student can identify an infinte loop in a program.
Student can halt a program with an infinite loop.


## programming.control.flow.concepts
Flow Concepts

### Objective

Students can explain the three types of flow {Sequential, Conditional, Repetative}

### Justification

Understanding the three types of flow is essential for describing most computational tasks.

### Assessment

Students can 




## programming.data.lists.concepts
List Concepts

### Objective

Students understands basic list properties:
* Ordered (elements have an order)
* Indexable (each element has an index starting from 0)
* Mutable (append, insert, delete)

### Justification

Lists are an essential data structure for most non-trivial programs.

### Assessment

Students can describe list properties to the instructor and fellow students.
